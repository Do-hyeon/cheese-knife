## Compatibility recovery preview

Branch `codex/chzzk-compatibility-recovery` contains a 2.13.2 recovery preview based on upstream v2.13.1. It adds Vue-free controls/compression, cancelable HLS previews, scoped page lifecycles, and per-tab feature readiness. It is not the upstream store release.

165 automated tests passed; controlled real audio output and separate-browser public preview frame progression were also recorded. See the [independent implementation review](docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-10-08-implementation-review.md), [installed-Chrome VOD hold fix review](docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-10-08-vod-hold-review.md), and [whole-branch review and follow-up](docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-10-08-whole-branch-review.md). The [latest contribution-readiness summary](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-contribution-readiness.md) distinguishes installed acceptance, automated contracts and unverified boundaries across all 25 setting leaves and 25 styles. Earlier candidate/refresh-pending sections are historical records; full acceptance and release approval remain pending.

The [follow-up readiness review](docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-10-08-final-readiness-review.md) found reused sidebar-link/VOD-tooltip and hold-OFF cancellation defects. One user-approved fix pass added fourteen tests: twelve RED→GREEN plus two protective characterizations; Node136/style91/filter17 passed at that stage. After the user refreshed the extension, [controlled installed reuse and trusted VOD input checks](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-restored-settings-and-runtime-checks.md) also passed. A guarded deleted-message candidate and current mission/blocked CSS were added later; remaining actual-event/environment gaps are not counted as full restoration, and no contribution PR has been opened.

The Gain slider is now 48px with an 8px end gap, checked in installed Chrome. [Synthetic audio-quality diagnostics](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-audio-quality-and-gain-spacing.md) document defaults and transition improvement candidates, not a subjective sound-quality guarantee. DSP is unchanged. Reproduce with `node scripts/check-audio-quality.mjs --chrome`; a fresh profile captures synthetic floating output while sending zeros to speakers, without recording broadcasts.

The [follow-up Gain smoothing and preview-delay fix](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-gain-smoothing-follow-up.md) ramps updates over 10ms and overlaps loading with the hover delay. The user confirmed preview works normally. After the [full-feature audit](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-full-feature-audit.md), the left-chat live player collapse was fixed and installed live/VOD layout and chat resizing were checked. The latest review fixes settings races, preview cancellation, popup dragging and feature status updates; installed acceptance requires another extension refresh. [Full-feature acceptance](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-08-full-feature-acceptance.md) is incomplete and no contribution PR has been opened.

Check out this branch, load the repository root or built `dist` at `chrome://extensions`, temporarily disable the old Cheese Knife extension to avoid duplicate injection, and reload CHZZK tabs. A local extension with a different ID does not automatically share store-extension settings. Do not delete the old extension or its settings.

A guarded [live deleted-chat candidate](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-restored-settings-and-runtime-checks.md) preserves native content and other listeners without JSX, historical recovery or server lookup. The user confirmed earlier installed readiness and original OFF restoration, not an actual natural deletion event/label rendering. Current automated records are deleted29/full165/style108/filter17; the additional ownership fix awaits manual extension refresh and installed acceptance. Installed expanded mission hiding ON and original OFF restoration were checked; actual party/blocked targets were absent. Missing native contracts and VOD deletion remain limited. Native-button sidebar refresh/expansion passed basic installed checks, not every variant. Stats show resolution/measured FPS; unverified bitrate/latency are unknown. Compression requires an eligible same-origin blob source and may require a user gesture. Age-restricted previews are not played. Full installed-Chrome/Firefox verification is pending. See [validation](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-chzzk-compatibility.md), [design](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-chzzk-compatibility-design.md), and [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Develop with Node 24: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run check`, `npm run build`. The package excludes dependencies, tests and backup files.

The [new adapter/CSS review](docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-10-08-deleted-chat-and-style-review.md) identified stale retention after an external in-place hidden-status/content/identity change. The fix requires current NORMAL/type/identity/content ownership and retires mismatched records: seven RED→GREEN cases, deleted29/full165/style108/filter17 plus build/package checks passed. This additional candidate requires manual extension refresh for installed acceptance; it is not certified by the earlier readiness report.

Run explicit native CSS checks with `node scripts/check-styles.mjs --chrome`; these do not add a browser requirement to the Node test suite. [Installed preview timing and style audit](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-preview-timing-and-style-audit.md) records the configured one-second wait, temporary 100ms comparison, four scoped style candidates and remaining acceptance.

The [toolbar layout follow-up](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-installed-follow-up-and-toolbar-design.md) records 33 native CSS cases and 7 actual viewport/sidebar combinations. Top navigation uses the toolbar at 1800px or wider with search separated from menus; narrower views retain the native sidebar. Auto-hide now handles the current sticky header and keyboard focus. Installed-Chrome checks passed for both enabled options, focus recovery and five viewports; full style acceptance remains incomplete.

Run synthetic video filter diagnostics with `node scripts/check-video-filters.mjs --chrome`. Seventeen cases check actual CSS-filtered video pixels, reset, native PZP filter preservation and single application, but do not guarantee the user's GPU behavior or sharpening edge quality. The [installed-filter investigation](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-restored-settings-and-runtime-checks.md) distinguishes failures, regressions and pending installed acceptance.

The [home recommendation hiding candidate](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-home-recommendation-recovery.md) hides only the ordinary home recommendation grid, preserving editorial promotions, following and recent VODs. The responsive fix passed Node 101 and native CSS 40 cases, followed by installed narrow/wide rerender, route cleanup/reapplication and stored-option OFF/ON restoration checks without temporary CSS. [Additional installed checks](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-installed-remaining-function-checks.md) include user-confirmed fullscreen/Esc operation and subsequent start-time selector recovery. Remaining full acceptance is still in progress.

[Player-style checks](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-style-baseline-and-acceptance.md) confirmed button hiding, volume-label toggling and restoration, and identified a current VOD fit-player regression caused by the legacy selector and inline height reservation. That change passed Node109, native CSS49 and actual temporary-rule VOD A/B checks. The refreshed extension's stored option ON passed basic normal/wide-mode checks without temporary CSS, followed by original OFF restoration. The scoped nickname-badge fix passed Node109, native CSS58 and actual temporary-rule live/VOD A/B checks; the refreshed extension also passed basic font8 badge, multi-badge and emote sizing without temporary CSS. Original chat-setting restoration, sidebar checks and remaining full acceptance are in progress. Account entitlement prevents actual time-machine verification, which is not counted as full acceptance.

The [start-time follow-up](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-start-time-selector-recovery.md) adds current live/VOD targets while preserving existing lookup, cache, cancellation and URL guards. After manual refresh, basic installed display, reentry, route cleanup and replacement-card cache reuse were confirmed. VOD screenshot capture and all-mode/full-feature acceptance remain separate boundaries.

[Sidebar follow-up](docs/superpowers/validation/2026-10-08-style-baseline-and-acceptance.md) confirmed original chat/sidebar setting restoration but found that ordinal hiding rules could hide general navigation during partial loading. Four current-DOM rules now use owned section identity markers while retaining scoped legacy rules. Node120, separate-profile browser84 (including production JS/CSS integration), build and package checks passed. Installed acceptance requires a manual extension refresh; full acceptance and PR creation remain pending.

## Features

The refreshed extension preserved general navigation during cold loading, expanded hiding and basic SPA transitions. Actual collapse removes the entire service header; that input is now covered by a follow-up correction with Node122/browser84 passing. The refreshed follow-up retained hiding without temporary CSS during actual collapse, native compact-state restoration after reload and compact SPA transitions. Remaining toolbar/explore/profile setting checks, full acceptance and PR creation remain pending.

Stored toolbar/explore/badge option inversion and basic responsive layout were checked. A two-selector CSS correction for missed live/VOD channel-info avatars passed Node122/browser91 and actual temporary-rule A/B checks. The refreshed extension subsequently preserved sizes and generic thumbnails while squaring those profiles; the original eight settings were restored. Blocked-broadcast hiding remains unverified without an actual blocked target and is not counted as full acceptance.

An installed filter test reproduced native PZP CSS overriding the extension filter. A CSS candidate preserves the native video pipeline and applies the extension filter once to its source wrapper. Node122/style91/filter17 and actual VOD temporary application/removal passed. Actual live A/B remains unverified because of a diagnostic limitation; full new-CSS installed acceptance and neutral-setting restoration require manual extension refresh. Full acceptance, final review and PR creation remain pending.
